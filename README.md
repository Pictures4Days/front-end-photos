### Handling Divergence of Ideas, Execution Tasks, and Duties

Undoing, redoing, replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered unacceptable. The team plans to account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties by having frequent team meetings to discuss progress and any issues that arise. 

## Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handling disagreements should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary. 

### Resolving Conflicts

The team will first try to resolve conflicts through 1-1 conversations or a team meeting. If the conflict is not resolved at this level, the team will elevate the issue to Audrey. 

### Addressing Dominant Team Members

If one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute, the team will immediately pull everyone into a team meeting to help break-up the labor.

### Approaching Different Levels of Understanding and Skill

The team plans to communicate any concerns about understanding and skill levels through Slack messages, and if necessary, move the discussion to a huddle for further detail. 

### Raising Concerns for Inadequate Contributions

The team will first try to address concerns about inadequate contributions through 1-1 conversations or a team meeting. If the issue is not resolved at this level, the team will elevate the issue to Audrey. 

### Escalating Conflicts

If resolution attempts are unsuccessful, the team will escalate the conflict to Audrey or the Code Fellows staff. 

## Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up. 

### Availability for Communication

Slack messages at 9, meeting at 9:30 to resolve git pulls, and talk over the day's plans and the team's needs. 

### Platforms for Communication

Slack, Zoom, Remo

### Frequency of Breaks

As needed, but a definite lunch break for all that may vary per time zone.

### Falling Behind

If the team starts to fall behind, they will reach out to the TA and Audrey for help on any unresolved coding issues without delay. 

### Communication after Hours and on the Weekend

Slack

### Ensuring Everyone's Voice is Heard

Awkward silences in meetings to ensure everyone feels they can speak.

### Creating a Safe Environment

The team will conduct temperature checks on everyone's feelings about the direction and the way they go about solving problems.
